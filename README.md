# DX Couriers PHP Wrapper

PHP SDK Wrapper Library for  [DX Couriers](https://www.dxdelivery.com/) REST API.

Right now it allows you to CREATE, GET LABEL, AMEND (date only) and DELETE consignments.

Currently DX's REST API doesn't include functionality for live tracking or webhooks.  This has been added by wrapping their front end tracking systems.

It's been tested with Mainland U.K addresses only just now. 

## Installation

Install via composer

```bash
composer require galaxycube/dx-courier
```

## Usage
